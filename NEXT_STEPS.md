---

## Current Status Summary

- **Model Accuracy**: **53.54%** (RFE model, 10 features) / **51.69%** (Full model, 60 features) - **True predictive power** with RS-only features and temporal split (retrained Dec 6, 2025)
- **Test Case Pass Rate**: 68.8% (11/16)
- **False Positive Detection**: 83.3% pass rate (5/6) - **Strong** ✅
- **True Positive Detection**: 62.5% pass rate (5/8)
- **Rim Pressure Data Coverage**: 95.9% (1,773/1,849) - **Fixed December 5, 2025** ✅
- **Data Leakage**: ✅ **FIXED** - All playoff features removed, temporal split implemented (December 6, 2025)
- **Previous Playoff Features**: ✅ **INTEGRATED** - Added legitimate past → future features (December 6, 2025)

**Key Discovery**: Trust Fall experiment revealed **Ground Truth Trap** - model correctly predicts Performance (outcomes), but we need a separate dimension for Dependence (portability).

---

## Trust Fall Experiment: Complete ✅

**Status**: Experiment completed December 5, 2025

**Results**:
- **With gates**: 87.5% pass rate (14/16)
- **Without gates**: 56.2% pass rate (9/16)
- **Diagnosis**: Model cannot learn system merchant patterns from current features

**Key Finding**: Jordan Poole returns to "King" status (97% star-level) when gates disabled - **he actually succeeded** (17 PPG, 62.7% TS in championship run). This confirms the **Ground Truth Trap**: Training labels are based on outcomes, but we want to predict portability.

**See**: `results/latent_star_test_cases_report_trust_fall.md` for complete results.

## ✅ Completed: Data Leakage Fixes

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - December 6, 2025

**The Problem**: Model was using playoff data in features to predict playoff outcomes, creating a circular dependency. Additionally, random train/test split allowed future data to inform past predictions.

**The Fix**:
1. **Removed Playoff-Based Features**: Removed all features that use playoff data (e.g., `PRESSURE_APPETITE_DELTA`, `RIM_PRESSURE_RESILIENCE`, `PO_EFG_BEYOND_RS_MEDIAN`)
2. **Implemented Temporal Train/Test Split**: Train on 2015-2020 seasons, test on 2021-2024 seasons
3. **Re-ran RFE Feature Selection**: Identified optimal 10 features from RS-only feature set
4. **Retrained Models**: Both full and RFE models retrained with RS-only features

**Results**:
- ✅ **True Accuracy**: 53.54% (RFE model) / 51.69% (Full model) - down from 63.33% with leakage
- ✅ **All Features RS-Only**: No playoff features in top 10 RFE-selected features
- ✅ **Temporal Split Working**: Train on past (574 samples), test on future (325 samples)
- ✅ **Production-Ready**: Model can now predict 2024-25 playoffs from 2024-25 RS data

**Key Insight**: The accuracy drop (~11-15 percentage points) represents the **true predictive power** of the model. Previous 63.33% accuracy was inflated by data leakage.

**See**: `DATA_LEAKAGE_FIXES_IMPLEMENTED.md` for implementation details and `results/data_leakage_fix_results.md` for results.

## ✅ Completed: Previous Playoff Features Integration

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - December 6, 2025

**The Addition**: Added previous playoff performance features (legitimate past → future, not data leakage).

**Features Added**:
- PREV_PO_RIM_APPETITE, PREV_PO_PRESSURE_RESILIENCE, PREV_PO_PRESSURE_APPETITE, PREV_PO_FTr, PREV_PO_LATE_CLOCK_PRESSURE_RESILIENCE, PREV_PO_EARLY_CLOCK_PRESSURE_RESILIENCE, PREV_PO_ARCHETYPE, HAS_PLAYOFF_EXPERIENCE

**Results**:
- ✅ **RFE Model Improved**: 48.31% → 53.54% (+5.23 percentage points)
- ✅ **Full Model Stable**: 52.62% → 51.69% (-0.93 percentage points)
- ✅ **Feature Rankings**: Previous playoff features ranked 21-46 out of 60 (not in top 15)
- ✅ **Data Coverage**: 50% of player-seasons have previous playoff data (2,625/5,256)

**Key Insight**: Previous playoff features provide signal for players with playoff experience, but most test cases are young players without playoff history. Features are most valuable for veteran players.

**See**: `results/previous_playoff_features_results.md` for complete analysis.

## 2D Risk Matrix Implementation: ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: Implementation complete (December 5, 2025)

**What Was Implemented**:
- ✅ Dependence Score calculation from quantitative proxies
- ✅ 2D prediction function (`predict_with_risk_matrix()`)
- ✅ Data-driven thresholds (33rd/66th percentiles: 0.3570/0.4482)
- ✅ Risk quadrant categorization (Franchise Cornerstone, Luxury Component, Depth, Avoid)
- ✅ Gate logic refinements (High-Usage Immunity, High-Usage Creator Exemption)
- ✅ Validation test suite (`test_2d_risk_matrix.py`)

**Key Results**:
- ✅ Luka Dončić correctly identified as **Franchise Cornerstone** (96.87% Performance, 26.59% Dependence)
- ✅ Jordan Poole correctly identified as **Luxury Component** (58.62% Performance, 51.42% Dependence)
- ✅ Data-driven thresholds replace arbitrary 0.30/0.70 cutoffs

**See**: `2D_RISK_MATRIX_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for complete implementation details and `results/data_driven_thresholds_summary.md` for threshold analysis.

## ✅ Completed: D'Angelo Russell Investigation

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - December 5, 2025

**The Discovery**: D'Angelo Russell was being incorrectly exempted from the Fragility Gate by the High-Usage Creator Exemption (designed for Luka). Russell has high creation volume (75%) but inefficient creation (negative creation tax: -0.101) and zero rim pressure (0.159, below bottom 20th percentile).

**The Fix**: Refined the exemption to require efficient creation (CREATION_TAX >= -0.05) OR minimal rim pressure (RS_RIM_APPETITE >= bottom 20th percentile). This distinguishes between versatile creators (Luka) and limited creators (Russell).

**Results**:
- ✅ D'Angelo Russell: 99% → 30% star-level (Victim) ✅
- ✅ Luka Dončić: Still 96.87% star-level (Bulldozer) ✅
- ✅ Test suite: 87.5% → 93.75% pass rate (+6.25 pp) ✅

**Key Insight**: Creation volume ≠ creation quality. The exemption must check for "Stabilizers" (rim pressure or efficient creation), not just volume.

**See**: `results/dangelo_russell_deep_dive.md` for complete analysis.

## ✅ Completed: Expanded Dataset Analysis

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - December 5, 2025

**What Was Done**:
- ✅ Created `run_expanded_predictions.py` script to run model on expanded dataset
- ✅ Ran predictions on 1,849 player-seasons (Age ≤ 25, Min 500 minutes)
- ✅ Generated comprehensive results with 2D Risk Matrix predictions
- ✅ Analyzed model misses and identified root causes

**Key Findings**:
- ✅ Model performing well overall - 7/10 "misses" are either correct or debatable
- ⚠️ **Volume Exemption Too Broad**: Catches "Empty Calories" creators (high volume + negative tax)
- ⚠️ **Missing Rim Pressure Data**: 80% of misses lack data, preventing Fragility Gate

**See**: `results/expanded_predictions.csv` for full results and `results/model_misses_analysis.md` for detailed analysis.

## Current Priority: Refine Volume Exemption Logic

**Status**: 🔴 **HIGH PRIORITY** - Ready for implementation

**The Problem**: Volume Exemption (`CREATION_VOLUME_RATIO > 0.60`) is too broad. It exempts "Empty Calories" creators (high volume + negative creation tax) from Multi-Signal Tax, when it should only exempt "True Creators" (high volume + efficient creation OR rim pressure).

**The Pattern**: "Empty Calories" creators like Willy Hernangomez, Dion Waiters, Kris Dunn have:
- High creation volume (>0.60) → Volume Exemption protects them
- Negative creation tax (<-0.10) → But they're inefficient creators
- Result: Model predicts "King" (93.27%, 77.55%, 84.96%) but they're actually "Volume Scorers"
- **Note**: All now have rim pressure data (95.9% coverage), but Fragility Gate still not catching them

**The Fix**: Refine Volume Exemption to require:
```python
CREATION_VOLUME_RATIO > 0.60 AND (CREATION_TAX >= -0.05 OR RS_RIM_APPETITE >= 0.1746)
```

**Rationale**:
- High volume alone doesn't make you a star
- Need either efficient creation (CREATION_TAX >= -0.05) OR rim pressure (stabilizer)
- This catches "Empty Calories" creators while preserving true creators (Schröder, Fultz)

**Expected Impact**:
- Would catch Willy Hernangomez (currently 93.27%, has rim pressure data but still overvalued)
- Would catch Dion Waiters (currently 77.55%, CREATION_TAX = -0.164)
- Would catch Kris Dunn (currently 84.96%, CREATION_TAX = -0.062)
- Would preserve Dennis Schröder (CREATION_TAX = +0.058)
- Would preserve Markelle Fultz (CREATION_TAX = -0.033, essentially neutral)

**Implementation Location**: `src/nba_data/scripts/predict_conditional_archetype.py`
- Find Multi-Signal Tax exemption logic (around line 570-590)
- Update Volume Exemption condition to include efficiency/stabilizer check
- **Context**: Rim pressure data is now available for 95.9% of players, so this check will work for almost all cases

**Validation**:
- Run `test_latent_star_cases.py` to ensure no regressions
- Run `run_expanded_predictions.py` to check expanded dataset
- Verify that Willy Hernangomez, Dion Waiters, Kris Dunn are now correctly filtered
- Verify that Dennis Schröder, Markelle Fultz are still correctly exempted

## Remaining Considerations

### Test Suite Refinement

**Status**: 2 test cases may be removed from test suite

**Cases**:
- ⚠️ **Mikal Bridges** (30.00%, expected ≥65%) - Usage Shock case, may be accurately rated
- ⚠️ **Desmond Bane** (26.05%, expected ≥65%) - Unclear if actually broke out (as of Dec 2025)

**Action**: Evaluate if these are legitimate model predictions or actual failures. If accurately rated, remove from test suite.

## ✅ Completed: Rim Pressure Data Fix

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - December 5, 2025

**The Problem**: Only 34.9% (645/1,849) of players in expanded predictions had rim pressure data, preventing Fragility Gate from applying to 65% of players. Root cause: Shot chart collection only collected data for players in `regular_season_{season}.csv` (filtered to GP >= 50, MIN >= 20.0), excluding many young players and role players.

**The Fix**: 
1. Modified `collect_shot_charts.py` to use `predictive_dataset.csv` instead of `regular_season` files
2. Added `--use-predictive-dataset` flag to collect shot charts for all players (5,312 vs. ~2,000 before)
3. Re-collected shot charts for all 10 seasons
4. Re-calculated rim pressure features (4,842 players vs. 1,845 before)
5. Re-trained model and re-ran predictions

**Results**:
- ✅ Rim pressure data coverage: 95.9% (1,773/1,849) vs. 34.9% before - **2.7x increase**
- ✅ All test cases now have rim pressure data
- ⚠️ Model misses (Willy Hernangomez, Dion Waiters, Kris Dunn) still overvalued - **Fragility Gate logic needs refinement**

**Key Insight**: Having rim pressure data is necessary but not sufficient. The Fragility Gate still isn't catching "Empty Calories" creators because Volume Exemption is too broad.

# NBA Playoff Resilience Engine

**Goal:** Identify players who consistently perform better than expected in the playoffs, and explain *why* using mechanistic insights.

**Current Status & Key Insight (V4.2 - Complete)**

The project has successfully developed a complete "Stylistic Stress Test" system to predict and explain playoff resilience.

- **`V4.2 Predictive Model`**: An XGBoost Classifier that achieves **59.4% accuracy** in predicting a player's Playoff Archetype (King, Bulldozer, Sniper, Victim) based on five Regular Season "Stress Vectors":
    1.  **Creation Vector**: Measures efficiency drop-off when forced to create own shot.
    2.  **Leverage Vector**: Measures how efficiency and usage scale in clutch situations.
    3.  **Pressure Vector (V4.2 Refined)**: Measures willingness to take tight shots with **Clock Distinction** (late-clock bailouts vs. early-clock bad shots).
    4.  **Physicality Vector**: **Rim Pressure Resilience** - maintains rim attack volume in playoffs.
    5.  **Plasticity Vector**: Spatial and temporal shot distribution changes.

- **`Complete Dataset`**: **10 seasons (2015-2024)** with 5,312 player-season records and full historical context data.
- **`Clock Data Coverage`**: **100% coverage** across all seasons (2015-16 through 2024-25) with optimized parallel collection.

## Next Developer Mission: Sloan Paper Drafting

The predictive engine is production-ready. The path forward is to create compelling visualizations and draft the Sloan conference paper.

1.  **Review Results**: See `results/predictive_model_report.md` for current V4.2 performance (59.4% accuracy).
2.  **Draft Narrative**: Focus on the "Abdication Tax" and mechanistic stress vectors.
3.  **Create Visualizations**: "Pressure Appetite vs. Playoff Performance" charts.

## Quick Start for New Developers

### 1. Understand the Vision & Current State
*   **`LUKA_SIMMONS_PARADOX.md`**: **CRITICAL.** Understands the core *descriptive* problem we solved.
*   **`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`**: The roadmap, now completed through Phase 7.

### 2. Set Up Environment
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn scipy tenacity requests xgboost tqdm tabulate seaborn matplotlib joblib

# Create required directories
mkdir -p data/cache models results logs
```

### 3. Run the Full Pipeline
This generates the two key artifacts: the *labels* (Archetypes) and the *features* (Stress Vectors), then trains the model.

```bash
# 1. Generate Historical Archetypes (The Labels)
python src/nba_data/scripts/calculate_simple_resilience.py

# 2. Generate Predictive Features (The Stress Vectors)
python src/nba_data/scripts/evaluate_plasticity_potential.py
python src/nba_data/scripts/calculate_physicality_features.py # NEW V4

# 3. Generate Pressure Features
python src/nba_data/scripts/collect_shot_quality_aggregates.py --seasons 2015-16 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23 2023-24 2024-25
# 3a. Generate Pressure Features with Shot Clock (V4.2 - Required for full accuracy)
python src/nba_data/scripts/collect_shot_quality_with_clock.py --seasons 2015-16 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23 2023-24 2024-25 --workers 8
python src/nba_data/scripts/calculate_shot_difficulty_features.py

# 4. Train the Predictive Model
python src/nba_data/scripts/train_predictive_model.py
```

**Key Outputs:**
*   `results/resilience_archetypes.csv`: The descriptive labels.
*   `results/predictive_dataset.csv`: The predictive features.
*   `results/pressure_features.csv`: The pressure vector features.
*   `models/resilience_xgb.pkl`: The trained XGBoost model.
*   `results/feature_importance.png`: Explains *why* the model works.

## The "Sloan Path" (Phase 6)

We have achieved the core goal of building a predictive model. The next phase is to refine it and prepare the findings for publication.

**Core Finding Validated:** Playoff resilience is predicted by a player's ability to **create their own offense**, **absorb responsibility in the clutch**, and **force the issue** (Pressure Appetite).

**Current Status:** Model accuracy is **59.4%** with full clock data coverage. The model successfully predicts playoff archetypes using mechanistic stress vectors.

See **`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`** for the detailed roadmap.

## Key Principles

1.  **First Principles Thinking:** Don't just measure *what* happened. Isolate the *stylistic shifts* that explain *why*.
2.  **Resilience = Efficiency × Volume:** The "Abdication Tax" is real. Passivity is failure.
3.  **Self-Creation is King:** The strongest predictor of playoff success is the ability to generate your own offense.
4.  **Dominance is Rigid:** Some players (Shaq/Giannis) are resilient not because they adapt, but because they impose their will. We measure this as "Pressure Appetite."

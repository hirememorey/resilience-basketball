## 🔬 Experiment: The Playoff Resilience Score

As a proof of concept, we have developed and tested a script to calculate the initial "Method Resilience Score." This experiment validates our data pipeline and core hypotheses on a player-by-player basis. The next iteration of this score will be a more robust, two-pillar metric.

-   **Proof of Concept**: `src/nba_data/scripts/calculate_resilience_scores.py` provides a working implementation of the *method* score calculation, which will serve as one half of the final score.
-   **Benchmark Data**: The script relies on league-average efficiency benchmarks, which are calculated by `src/nba_data/scripts/calculate_league_averages.py`.
-   **Detailed Methodology**: The complete first-principles logic for the refined, two-pillar calculation is documented in `foundational_principles.md`.

This experiment serves as the foundation for the next phase of the project: evolving the score and scaling this analysis across the entire league to build a predictive model.

## 🔬 Research Framework

### Core Hypotheses (Ready for Testing!)
1. **Method Resilience**: A player's ability to maintain offensive output in the playoffs is tied to the diversity of their scoring methods.
2. **Method Over-Specialization Fragility**: One-dimensional players are more vulnerable to playoff schemes that target their primary strength.
3. **Adaptability Measurement**: Year-over-year changes in a player's scoring profile indicate playoff readiness.

### The "Playoff Resilience Score": A Two-Pillar Approach
Our primary analytical goal is to create a holistic measure of playoff resilience. The refined score moves beyond just analyzing a player's style to incorporate their actual performance. It is built on two pillars:

1.  **Performance Resilience (The "What")**: This pillar answers the most important question: "Does the player's raw effectiveness decline?" It measures the playoff-to-regular-season change in core efficiency metrics like **True Shooting % (TS%)**, **Points Per Possession (PPP)**, and **Turnover % (TOV%)**. It grounds the model in the outcomes that actually matter.

2.  **Method Resilience (The "How")**: This pillar quantifies a player's offensive adaptability and answers the question: "Is the player's offensive process compromised?" It is calculated using a diversity index based on three sub-pillars:
    - **Spatial Diversity**: Efficiency and volume from different zones on the court.
    - **Play-Type Diversity**: Efficiency and usage across different offensive sets.
    - **Creation Diversity**: Ability to score in different ways (Catch & Shoot, Pull-ups, Drives).

The final score will analyze the change in a player's combined performance and method scores from the regular season to the playoffs, identifying players whose game is truly resistant to targeted defensive pressure. For a detailed breakdown of the refined methodology, see `foundational_principles.md`.

**✅ FULLY UNBLOCKED:** Complete individual player tracking data across entire NBA (569 players × 105+ metrics)

### Guiding Principles (Still Valid)
- **Dynamic over Static**: Focus on career trajectories vs. single-season snapshots
- **Leading Indicators**: Predict playoff success from regular-season patterns
- **Beyond Box Scores**: Include advanced metrics and play-type distributions
- **Context Matters**: Account for age, team changes, and opponent quality
- **Validate Data First**: Never build analytics on untested data sources

### Success Criteria
- **Predictive Accuracy**: Model correctly identifies playoff performance patterns
- **Actionable Insights**: Clear recommendations for team decision-makers
- **Research Publication**: Suitable for MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference

## 🛠️ Development

### Next Steps: From Experiment to Production Model

The immediate priority is to evolve the proof-of-concept `calculate_resilience_scores.py` into a robust, league-wide analysis pipeline.

1.  **Scale the Calculation**: Refactor the script to calculate the resilience score for all players in the database in a single run, not just one hardcoded player.
2.  **Store the Scores**: Add a new table to the database to store the calculated pillar scores, overall scores, and deltas for every player.
3.  **Build Predictive Models**: With a complete dataset of resilience scores, begin building machine learning models to identify the regular-season metrics that are most predictive of a high (or stable) resilience score.
4.  **Longitudinal Analysis**: Extend the scripts to handle multiple seasons to analyze how a player's resilience score evolves over their career.

### Quality Assurance
- All data passes statistical validation
- API rate limiting prevents service disruption
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Resilience metrics validated against performance indicators

## 📚 Key Insights Developed

### Data Pipeline Architecture
- **Evidence-Driven Development**: Direct API inspection over assumptions
- **Validation-First Approach**: Test data quality before scaling
- **Modular Design**: Components can be independently updated

### NBA Analytics Challenges (Critical Lessons Learned)
- **API Parameter Discovery**: NBA Stats API returns team aggregates by default - `PlayerOrTeam=Player` unlocks individual player data
- **Individual vs Aggregate Data**: Tracking endpoints return different data structures based on parameters
- **API Reliability Myth**: Even "working" APIs can return empty data - validate content, not just HTTP status
- **Data Availability Reality**: NBA Stats API play-by-play endpoints return empty responses for some data types
- **Premature Implementation Risk**: Building analytics frameworks on unvalidated data sources wastes significant effort
- **Simplified Approach Success**: Direct, evidence-driven implementation more effective than over-engineered solutions
- **Static Data Efficiency**: Known constants (NBA teams) more reliable than API calls for unchanging data

### Performance Optimizations
- **Intelligent Caching**: 1-day cache expiration balances freshness vs. performance
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of 500+ player datasets
- **Memory Management**: Streaming data processing for large datasets
- **Resilience Metrics**: Lightweight calculation enables real-time analysis

### Research Methodology (Lessons Learned)
- **Hypothesis-Driven Development**: Start with research questions, adapt data strategy accordingly
- **API Parameter Investigation**: Always test different parameter combinations to unlock full data access
- **Data Validation Critical**: Never build frameworks on untested data sources
- **Premature Implementation Risk**: Statistical approximations without data validation waste effort
- **Framework Viability**: Core hypotheses require possession data, not box score proxies
- **Individual Player Data Breakthrough**: Fixed NBA Stats API to provide granular player tracking data

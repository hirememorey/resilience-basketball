# Brunson Test: Historical Validation Report

**Detection Season:** 2020-21
**Subsequent Seasons Checked:** 2021-22, 2022-23, 2023-24

## Executive Summary

- **Total Latent Stars Identified:** 6
- **Breakouts Detected:** 2
- **Breakout Rate:** 33.3%

---

## Methodology

The Brunson Test validates that the latent star detection system can identify
players **before** they break out. The test:

1. Identifies latent stars in a given season (players with high stress profiles but low usage)
2. Checks if those players saw significant usage/value spikes in subsequent seasons
3. Calculates the breakout rate to measure predictive value

**Breakout Definition:** USG% increase of ≥5% in any subsequent season

## Results

### Successful Breakouts

| Player | Detection USG% | Max Subsequent USG% | Increase | Breakout Season(s) |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|----------|-------------------|
| Jalen Brunson | 19.6% | 31.1% | +11.5% | 2022-23 (+7.0%), 2023-24 (+11.5%) |
| Tyrese Haliburton | 17.5% | 23.9% | +6.4% | 2022-23 (+6.3%), 2023-24 (+6.4%) |

---

## Interpretation

A breakout rate of 33.3% indicates:

- **>30%**: Strong predictive value (model identifies real latent stars)
- **15-30%**: Moderate predictive value (some false positives)
- **<15%**: Weak predictive value (mostly noise, not signal)
